## How Was Jorrit Able to Access This Paper Now?

Work with GBatNet group for 3.5 years in which:
 
 * goals were identified
    * (G1) make bat interaction data digitally accessible,
    * (G2) align bat taxonomic names to uncover their meaning, and
    * (G3) provide open-access to bat literature. 
 * Plazi provided a legal framework ^[needs citation]
 * BatBase provided curatorial support 
 * Jorrit reused work done in tracking, packaging and versioning biodiversity datsets 
 * Collectors/researchers shared their literature collections

## BatLit Workflow

![BatLit Workflow](img/workflow.png)


## Introducing BatLit

 1. Curator Adds Digital Copy to BatLit Project on Zotero ^[https://www.zotero.org/groups/5435545/bat_literature_project]
 2. Periodically, Archivist takes a snapshot of all Zotero records in BatLit, including bibliographic metadata and the "physical" digital copy (pdf).
 3. Archivist puts the snapshots in a signed digital archive (box) and signs the provenance logs
 4. Signed Digital Archive (or a batlit corpus version) is mobilized by translating and upload them to Zenodo, GitHub Pages, and various other network attached storage media
 5. Signed Digital Archives is stored on offline enabled media (sd card, external hard disk)
 6. Corpus is transmitted and discovered by students researchers
 6. Corpus is reused by students and researchers, enabling both manual (e.g., reading, annotation) and automated (e.g., raw material for language model training) workflows  
 7. Reuse promotes improvement and further awareness

## How To Access This Paper Now?

Take 2. 

 * turn on the internet (still there?)
 * open a web browser
 * load https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13342373
   * and rely on a delicate and complex socio-technical network

## Internet Is Designed For *Exchanging* Information 

> The internet is a powerful tool for exchanging digital information. But the Internetâ€™s contents changes constantly: websites are launched and taken down, webpages change, and content gets archived or lost.^[Jorrit Poelen. 2024. Unleashing Digital Knowledge Into The Future. Accessed on 2024-02-06 at https://linker.bio [line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L12](https://linker.bio/line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L12)]

---

## Internet Is *Location-based*

> By design, a web address, or Uniform Resource Locator (URL), points to a specific internet location from which a resource, like a webpage, can be retrieved. However, a URL does not provide a way to verify that a retrieved webpage was the one we asked for. ^[Jorrit Poelen. 2024. Unleashing Digital Knowledge Into The Future. Accessed on 2024-02-06 at https://linker.bio [line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L14](https://linker.bio/line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L14)]

---

## Finding Content By Their Location Is ... Tricky

> Imagine using a URL-like reference to find a book at a library: instead of locating a book by what it is (e.g., title, author), you refer to a book by its location (e.g., third shelf on the second row next to the window). With this, a book becomes unfindable if moved to another shelf. And, if you do manage to find a book at the referenced location, how would you know youâ€™ve found the book you are looking for? ^[Jorrit Poelen. 2024. Unleashing Digital Knowledge Into The Future. Accessed on 2024-02-06 at https://linker.bio [line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L16](https://linker.bio/line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L16)]


---

## Finding Content By Their (Summarized) Content Is ... What Librarians Do

> Instead of pointing to where books are located, librarians point to them using a bibliographic reference. For practical reasons, only a few identifying clues are included in such a reference (e.g., author, year of publication, title, and publisher). **So, librarians refer to content by what it is, and knowing where it may be located is secondary.** ^[Jorrit Poelen. 2024. Unleashing Digital Knowledge Into The Future. Accessed on 2024-02-06 at https://linker.bio [line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L18](https://linker.bio/line:hash://sha256/8ac18eb75ff20d40d1d60bb6ad5a745eb528093d1ffbe373e3847c13146091eb!/L18)]
