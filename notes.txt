Name your file as Day_Time_YourLastName (e.g., Thursday_1430_Horst).  

To ensure that sessions run smoothly and on time, all oral presentations PowerPoint/PDF files should be uploaded to the provided Dropbox link or brought on a flash drive to the registration desk by 5:00 pm the day prior to the presentation. Presentation files will not be accepted the day of the presentation. Failure to submit your presentation file in a timely manner may result in a cancelled or rescheduled presentation.

NASBR uses a 16:9 (widescreen) projection format. It is highly recommended that you format your slides to be 16:9.  If your slides are in the old 4:3 format they may not occupy the entire screen (black borders on the sides) and will appear small to the audience.
